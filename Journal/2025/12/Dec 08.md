#### About Today
---

I do not like how I am around my Mom. I hate that I get  so revved up around her and I wish I could just drown her out but I do not know anyone that is more negative than her. I had just walked into her trailer when she started whining. She never even said, "Hi Tim" or anything.  I kept quiet for as long as I could but finally lost my patience. Then she went on about how she is welcoming death.  I got up and left. I could not listen anymore.  I have also had rough time of late, but I have not laid it on her.  I am tired of being dumped on when those same people never allow me to dump back. I have cut off Dad and am tempted to do the same to her. She does not get it. She never will.   Everything is about her. Everything.  She "apologized" and then expected me to come back.  Sigh.  Part of me wishes I had. Part of me wishes she did not get me so riled up.  Part of me. 

Blender did stuff with lighting today and it also discussed rendering a bit.
