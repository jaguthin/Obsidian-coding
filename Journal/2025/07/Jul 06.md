#### About Today
---
I started to do some working with Blender and Godot today. What I have learned is very, very basic but it is a start. Right now it is just about moving around but I think I understand it. I think I get how games work. Now I just need to actually build a game.  Tomorrow it is back to work.  I plan to take a walk in a bit. Just to the stop sign and back. It is not much but it is something.   When the basement is done and the garage is emptied, I should be able to access my bike much easier and take it out more often. Crazy to think it is already July.  I also watched another episode of the Twilight Zone and Fringe.  I may watch more but I am not sure, yet. I may, though.  The more I use obsidian, the more I like it. I hope, eventually, that my main apps will be this, obsidian, blender, [[Key Bindings]] and VSCodium. I am not sure if I should link to any of them here, but maybe.   I just linked to [[Key Bindings]]. Which is good because now I can just click and go there if I want. 

Other goals. Hmmm.  I am not sure.  If I continue to go for my AWS certificates it can only help but I really do not like how much time they are taking. That is my fault.  I set some very unrealistic goals to get them done. If I had more time, then they would not be so unrealistic but with almost 2 hours to go to work and 8 hours there, when I get home I do not really want to study. I want to read whatever book I am reading but I also want to work on crafts. When the basement is done, I plan to take everything out of my bedroom. Well, almost everything.  I will keep the desk and maybe the stuff for whatever project I am working on.  My goal is 500 words. That should not be that hard to accomplish but it is amazing to think of how much can be said without using many words. 

So, here are what I want right now

- AWS Certifications
- Learn Godot
- Learn Blender
- Learn Vietnamese. 
- Get over my fear of Video Calls and give Linh the best that I can give her.  She is very sweet and I look forward to doing more with her.  

Apparently my looms do not count toward my word count but I will update the Banned Books loom.  Perhaps I will even finish it.
