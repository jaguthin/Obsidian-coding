	- Liquidate fundrise and Ibond account
		- Pay off HELOC, if possible. Or pay off 401K so I only have the HELOC left. Rest can go to emergency or to pay down the HELOC. Either way, make it so only one is left. 
		- If I can't pay off my 401K loan, save it or invest it or maybe keep it and put any extra money aside.
