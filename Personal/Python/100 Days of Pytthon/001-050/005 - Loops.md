for item in list_of_items:


When extending a list it does not need to be assigned to a variable.
variable.extent(variable) as a variable was already assigned to it. 

sum(variable) - Can add all items in list. 

###### Range
for number in range(a, b, step):
   do something. 

for number in range(a):
   do stuff

Last number is not included so add one to get full number.
1-100 for example should be put as 1, 101
