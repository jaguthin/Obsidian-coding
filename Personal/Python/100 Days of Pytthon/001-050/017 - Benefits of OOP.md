### Create classes

class Name:

can use pass if function or class is empty. 

When naming a class, the first letter of every word should be capitalized.
(Pascal Case)
(camel case) first word is lower case, otherwise the same.
(snake case) all words are lower case but words are separated by underscore.

variable.attribute can be added to a class

### Constructor
```
```
```
def __init__(self, param, param, ...):  for initiazling attributes
	self.param = param
	self.default = "whatever"
def method(self, param, param, param, ... ):
	code

```

Anything in it will be applied to new objects

defaults do not have to be supplied when initializing object. 

A method does not need to have parameters other than self but they can be added but then need to be called if a method is used.
