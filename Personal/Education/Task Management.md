Need to put a table together and label what I do and how much time it all takes.


| Task | Time Start | Time End | Total Time | Category |
| ---- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- |
|      |            |          |            |          |
- What were my Time Thieves?
- How often was I doing something that someone else could have done?
- Do any of these tasks support my long-term goals?
- Did I bring any work home because I didn't use my work time efficiently?
- Did I use my leisure time as a reward/break or as a distraction from important items?
- How much time did I spend on relationships?

Type B should be the priority. 
Type C can be delegated.
