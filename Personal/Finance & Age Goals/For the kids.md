###### I have 300,000 in life insurance. I work for Aquila Technology. You will want to talk to Jackie Tyman or Yessy O'Donoghue. My salary as of this writing is: $150691.41 Annually.  I put 6% of my pay into 401K and they match 4% Their contact info is: 

###### 20 Burlington Mall Road, Suite 230
###### Burlington, MA 01803
###### (781) 993-9004
###### (781) 993-9005

Fundrise will not allow me to put Indhira as a beneficiary until she is 18 and can hold stocks.  Please ensure she is taken care of with that. 

At the time of this writing, I do not have any investment accounts. 

My intention is:
1) ~~Pay off the laptop~~
2) ~~Pay off the windows~~
3) ~~Pay back my 401K~~
4) ~~Freedom Fund to 60K~~
5) Freedom fund to 100K.
6) ~~Pay off the Maxima~~
7) Pay off the  HELOC Loan.
8) Pay down the house when freedom fund is where I want it. 
9) Sell the house and buy a boat or a tiny house then live there.
10) If that happens, I will not have my life insurance any more. But you all still get 1/3 of everything.  I put Jon as 33.34 and 33.33 for Allison and Indhira.

Indhira has an investment account with American Funds. 

###### With any luck, all will be paid back way before you have to worry about that.
