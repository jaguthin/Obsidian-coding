I try to be a positive thinker. I like to think that the flow of my life
is supposed to take me in wholesome directions meant to steer me toward
my Karmic growth. If this is true, then right now, in this place,
handcuffed to her bed ...

Wait. Stop.

Let me back up. No. Too many stray thoughts ...

I think it was the black lipstick that got me. But how was I to know I'd
find someone like her at a rest stop? My intentions were pure in that I
had no intentions at all. I'd simply pulled over to take a leak and
consult my map. The journey had grown long. My destination still so far
away. There she was. Sitting at a picnic table drinking a Red Bull and
eating a pack of Twizzlers. Her lips naturally pouty and ever more
intriguing with the fleck of Twizzler stuck to her full bottom lip.

I am but a man and knew that she could take me anywhere.

We spoke. I don't even remember what about. The memory is lost like
Waldo in one of those old books. Soon though, and that is what's
important, she invited me back to her place. What she mouthed was
innocent, but her lips held too much promise and, so , into her car i
went. She said she lived near.

Why is it we men, when our lust is engorged, don't bother to think. Why
did I not wonder what she was doing at a rest stop if she lived near?
Were the roles reversed, and it were a woman being tempted by a man, I
am sure she would simply have run to her car, locked the doors, thrown
the key in the ignition, and sped off. In that order.

But not me. Nope. Too blinded by promise. I am sure, if a voluptuous
woman were tempting me at the bottom of a cliff and I were on top, I'd
jump off to get to her, heedless of my own safety. I'd brave fire, hail,
floods, hurricanes. I'd brave my own stupidity.

But I digress. The point. It's here. Somewhere.

Back at her place. I have no idea how we got there. Why would I pay
attention to roads?

There was no champagne cork pop to mark the occasion. She wasted no time.

And there we were. No matter where you go, there you are. So there we
were. And she tempted me with the handcuffs. It was a possibility to
great to ignore. A chance for a story. Like Pandora's box, I released
all that was bad within me and let her chain me to that bed.

Ah, how I wish I could tell you a story worthy of the stamp of erotic
literature. But that is not the story I have for you, for the look of
seduction slipped from her eyes to be replaced with the red glow of a
predator. As she smiled with the wolfish gloat of a grandma killer, she
pulled something from a small box on the nightstand.

I think they call it a commando saw. It was a flexible, serrated length
of wire blade secured between two steel rings.

My feet, at the ankles, were the first to go.
