Inputs and outputs are separate from each other. 



def function():
	result = 3 * 2
	return result

example:
var = function()
Then var becomes equal to whatever is returned. 

Can return anything. It does not have to be a variable. 

### Docstrings

first indented line after function but it needs to be between three double quotes. 

Can be multiple lines. 

You can basically rename a function by using = for example:

new_func = func

Function now run as new_func
