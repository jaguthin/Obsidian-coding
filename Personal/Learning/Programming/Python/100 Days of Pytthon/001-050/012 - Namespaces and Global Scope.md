Local scope - within functions.

global by default outside of a function. 

global variables are accessible every where. 

Scope can apply to other stuff, too.  If a function is inside a function then the internal function is local. 

no block scope.

for a local variable or whatever state global before to use a global function. 
global var
var += 1 <-- for example

constants:
Use all upper case. Constants are for variable that never change.
