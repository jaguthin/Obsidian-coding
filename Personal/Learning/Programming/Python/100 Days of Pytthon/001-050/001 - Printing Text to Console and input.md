Basic stuff. How to create print statements.
Add \n to create  new line. 
Also covered that spaces are not automatically added if strings are concatenated. Space must be added.


The input function is how I can ask for input and add it to a variable. 


> # = Comment

CTRL-/ in pycharm will comment/uncomment the current line.

variables as well.
var = "command"
vars can be changed. 
Pycharm will wrap something if entire line is selected first.

variables can be almost anything ( Make them make sense) except: Numbers can't be at start of variable. Variable can't use reserved words.

spaces are not allowed in variables. One can separate words with underscores.
